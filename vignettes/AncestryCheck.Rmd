# Ancestry estimation
The identification of individuals of divergent ancestry can be achieved by
combining the genotypes of the study population with genotypes of a reference
dataset consisting of individuals from known ethnicities (for instance
individuals from the Hapmap or 1000 genomes study [@HapMap2005,@HapMap2007,
@HapMap2010,@a1000Genomes2015,@b1000Genomes2015]). Principal componeanalysis 
(PCA) on this combined genotype panel can then be used to detect
population structure down to the level of the reference dataset (for Hapmap and
1000 Genomes, this is down to large-scale continental ancestry).

In the following, the workflow for combining a study dataset with the
reference samples, conducting PCA and estimating ancestry is demonstrated.
The study dataset consists of 200 individuals and 10,000 genetic markers and
is provided with $plinkQC$ in `file.path(find.package('plinkQC'),'extdata')`.

# Workflow
## Download reference data
A suitable reference dataset should be downloaded and if necessary, re-formated
into PLINK format. Vignettes
['Processing HapMap III reference data for ancestry estimation'](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/plinkQC/articles/HapMap.html) and 
['Processing 1000Genomes  reference data for ancestry estimation'](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/plinkQC/articles/Genomes1000.html),
show the download and processing of the HapMap phase III and 1000Genomes phase
III dataset, respectively. In this example, we will use the HapmapIII data as
the reference dataset.

## Set-up
We will first set up some bash variables and create directories needed; storing
the names and directories of the reference and study will make it easy to use 
updated versions of the reference or new datasets in the future. We create a 
directory named 'qcdir' for the study data. 
Is is also useful to keep the PLINK log-files for future reference. In order to
keep the data directory tidy, we'll create a directory for the log files and
move them to the log directory here after each analysis step. 
Once you have created 'qcdir', be sure to copy the data.bim, data.bed, 
and data.fam files into your directory. If you are using HapMap III reference 
data, be sure to use the correct variable name; refname='HapMapIII'.  

```{bash setup, eval=FALSE}
qcdir=~/qcdir
refdir=~/reference
name='data'
refname='all_hg38'

mkdir -p $qcdir/plink_log
```

## Match study genotypes and reference data
In order to compute joint principal components of the reference and study
population, we will need to combine the two datasets. The plink --merge
function enables this merge, but requires the variants in the datasets to be
matching by chromosome, position and alleles. The following sections show how
to extract the relevant data from the reference and study dataset and how to
filter matching variants.

### Filter reference and study data for non A-T or G-C SNPs
We will use an awk script to find A→T and C→G SNPs. As these SNPs are more
difficult to align and only a subset of SNPs is required for the analysis, we
will remove them from both the reference and study data set. In addition,
we will only keep the autosomes (chr 1-22), keep snps only (snps-only),
of those, keep only the biallelic ones (max-alleles 2) and remove any duplicates
(rm-dup).

```{bash filter at and gc snps, eval=FALSE}
awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"}  ($5$6 == "GC" || $5$6 == "CG" \
                        || $5$6 == "AT" || $5$6 == "TA")  {print $2}' \
    $qcdir/$name.bim  > \
    $qcdir/$name.ac_gt_snps
awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"}  ($5$6 == "GC" || $5$6 == "CG" \
                        || $5$6 == "AT" || $5$6 == "TA")  {print $2}' \
    $refdir/$refname.bim  > \
    $qcdir/$refname.ac_gt_snps
   
plink2 --bfile  $refdir/$refname \
      --rm-dup exclude-all \
      --max-alleles 2 \
      --snps-only just-acgt \
      --exclude $qcdir/$refname.ac_gt_snps \
      --chr 1-22 \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$refname.no_ac_gt_snps
mv  $qcdir/$refname.no_ac_gt_snps.log $qcdir/plink_log/$refname.no_ac_gt_snps.log

plink2 --bfile  $qcdir/$name \
      --rm-dup exclude-all \
      --max-alleles 2 \
      --snps-only just-acgt \
      --exclude $qcdir/$name.ac_gt_snps \
      --make-bed \
      --chr 1-22 \
      --allow-extra-chr \
      --out $qcdir/$name.no_ac_gt_snps
mv  $qcdir/$name.no_ac_gt_snps.log $qcdir/plink_log/$name.no_ac_gt_snps.log
```

### Rename to common scheme
Variant identifiers can vary between studies and/or reference sets. For instance,
commonly used are either rsIDs or a name constructed from chr-position-alleles.
Here, we will make sure that we are dealing with the same identifiers for the
merge by renaming all variants by their chromosome and position, followed by
the genome build. As this might introduce additional duplicates (e.g. identifiers
that now are identical because of tri-allelic variants that could not be caught
in the previous step), we will also remove duplicates again.

```{bash}
plink2 --bfile  $qcdir/$name.no_ac_gt_snps \
      --set-all-var-ids @:#[hg38] \
      --rm-dup exclude-all \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$name.renamed
mv  $qcdir/$name.renamed.log $qcdir/plink_log

plink2 --bfile  $qcdir/$refname.no_ac_gt_snps \
      --set-all-var-ids @:#[hg38] \
      --rm-dup exclude-all \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$refname.renamed
mv  $qcdir/$refname.renamed.log $qcdir/plink_log
```

### Prune study data
We will conduct principle component analysis on genetic variants that are
pruned for variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with an $r^2 >0.2$ in a 50kb
window. The LD-pruned dataset is generated below, using plink --indep-pairwise
to compute the LD-variants; additionally exclude range is used to remove genomic
ranges of known high-LD structure. This file was originally provided by
@Anderson2010 and is available in
`file.path(find.package('plinkQC'),'extdata',' high-LD-regions-hg38-GRCh38.txt')`.
If there has been an update in reference data, this will need to be updated as 
well. 

```{bash prune, eval=FALSE}
highld='high-LD-regions-hg38-GRCh38.txt'

plink --bfile  $qcdir/$name.renamed \
      --exclude range  $qcdir/$highld \
      --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.2 \
      --out $qcdir/$name.renamed
mv  $qcdir/$name.renamed.log $qcdir/plink_log/$name.renamed.prune.log

```

```{bash rename}
plink --bfile  $qcdir/$name.renamed \
      --extract $qcdir/$name.renamed.prune.in \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$name.pruned
mv  $qcdir/$name.pruned.log $qcdir/plink_log/$name.pruned.log
```

### Filter reference data for the same SNP set as in study
We will use the list of pruned variants from the study sample to reduce the 
reference dataset to the size of the study samples:
Notes - make --bfile $refdir/$refname to $qcdir/$refname because the first is not converted 
```{bash filter, eval=FALSE}
plink --bfile  $qcdir/$refname.renamed \
      --extract $qcdir/$name.renamed.prune.in \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$refname.pruned
mv  $qcdir/$refname.pruned.log $qcdir/plink_log/$refname.pruned.log
```

## Merge study genotypes and reference data
The matching study and reference dataset can now be merged into a combined 
dataset with plink --bmerge. If all steps outlined above were conducted
successfully, no mismatch errors should occur.
```{bash merge, eval=FALSE}
plink --bfile $qcdir/$name.pruned \
      --bmerge $qcdir/$refname.pruned \
      --out $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname \
      --merge-mode 6
mv $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname.log $qcdir/plink_log/$name.merge.$refname.missnp.log

plink --bfile $qcdir/$name.pruned  \
      --bmerge $qcdir/$refname.pruned \
      --exclude $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname.missnp \
      --make-bed \
      --out $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname
mv $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname.log $qcdir/plink_log
```

## PCA on the merged data
We can now run principal component analysis on the combined dataset using
plink --pca which returns a .eigenvec file with the family and individual ID
in columns 1 and 2, followed by the first 20 principal components. 
```{bash pca, eval=FALSE}
plink --bfile $qcdir/$name.merge.$refname \
      --pca \
      --out $qcdir/$name.$refname
mv $qcdir/$name.$refname.log $qcdir/plink_log
```

## Check ancestry
We can use the .eigenvec file to estimate the ancestry of the study samples.
Identifying individuals of divergent ancestry is implemented in
`check_ancestry`. Currently, check ancestry only supports automatic selection of
individuals of European descent. It uses principal components 1
and 2 to find the center of the known European reference samples. All study
samples whose Euclidean distance from the centre falls outside the radius
specified by the maximum Euclidean distance of the reference samples multiplied
by the chosen `europeanTh` are considered non-European. `check_ancestry` shows
the result of the ancestry analysis in a scatter plot of PC1 versus
PC2 colour-coded for samples of the reference populations and the study
population. Reminder, if you are using HapMap III reference data, refname will
be the reference name you have used previously. Also, the files to use are 
"/HapMap_ID2Pop.txt" instead of the Genomes1000_ID2Pop and "HapMap_PopColors.txt".

Note: this vignette provides the 1000 Genomes annotation files, or the HapMap 
annotation files. If you choose to use either the 1000Genomes or  HapMap reference 
population data, you can simply use our color mapping files and it should work.  
If not, you must provide it to the function.  An example of the color scheme 
for the 1000 Genomes reference data is found in '1000Genomes_PopColors.txt'.  

From within R, run the following command to the ancestry check:
### For 1000 Genomes data
```{r check ancestry, eval=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
library(plinkQC)
indir <- system.file("extdata", package="plinkQC")
qcdir <- "~/qcdir"
name <- 'data'
refname <- 'all_hg38'
prefixMergedDataset <- paste(name, ".", refname, sep="")

exclude_ancestry <-
    evaluate_check_ancestry(indir=qcdir, name=name,
                            prefixMergedDataset=prefixMergedDataset,
                            refSamplesFile=paste(indir, 
                                                 "/Genomes1000_ID2Pop.txt",
                                                 sep=""), 
                            refColorsFile=paste(indir, 
                                                "/Genomes1000_PopColors.txt",
                                                sep=""),
                            interactive=TRUE)
```
```{r load ancestry, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("checkAncestry.png")
```
