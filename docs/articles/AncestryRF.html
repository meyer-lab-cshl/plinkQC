</h3>
<p>The previous <a href="https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/plinkQC/articles/AncestryCheck.html">Ancestry
estimation vignette</a> performed PCA from the combined study and
reference dataset and identified individuals of European descent based
on clustering of data in the first and second PC space. In this two
dimensional space, there is no adequate identification of individuals of
other ancestries. This vignette will train a random forest classifier
that uses up to 20 PCs to sufficiently estimate the study samples’
ancestry based on any ancestry in the reference dataset.</p>
<p>We use the .eigenvec file that was created when preparing files for
ancestry estimation, and read in its dataframe. The file contains the
eigenvectors for the PCA on the LD-pruned genotype data. The .eigenvec
file only included the eigenvalues per PC for each individual and did
not include any information regarding individual’s ancestries.
Therefore, the file available in the plinkQC download, which contains a
dataframe with each individual’s ID, their family ID, and their
associated ancestry must be obtained and read in, as obtained from the
1000 Genomes database. These two files are to be joined by ID and
filtered to remove any IDs where no genetic data were available.</p>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameters"></a>
</h2>
<p>Tuning the parameters for this random forest is crucial in building a
machine-learning model to produce the best forest, in this case having
the highest accuracy.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="number-of-trees">Number of Trees<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#number-of-trees"></a>
</h4>
<p>A random forest model is comprised of building several trees and the
‘Number of trees’ parameter decides exactly how many decision trees will
constitute the random forest. Although there exists a positive
relationship between the number of trees and predictive performance of
the model, there exists a point where continuing to increase the number
of trees will no longer find you a better prediction while elongating
computational efficiency. There also exists a tradeoff between
predictive performance and computational efficiency. Excess trees also
pose a possible issue of overfitting as more trees are trained. It is
important for your dataset to test and find the point of diminishing
returns. For the example below of the 1000 Genomes set, 500 trees allows
accurate predictions to be made, while also being computational
eficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="k-fold-cross-validation">K-fold Cross Validation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#k-fold-cross-validation"></a>
</h4>
<p>Cross-validation is used to estimate the skill of a machine learning
model on unseen data. When tuning this RF model, k-fold cross validation
is used to split bootstrapped datasets into random groups, holding one
group as test data and training the different models (the individual
decision trees) on the remaining groups, where ‘k’ is the number of
folds/groups in the dataset. Using k=5 or k=10 is common and usually
arbitrarily chosen, depending on the size of the dataset. A higher
number of folds tends to lead to a more accurate model as you are
splitting. In the example below, k=10 for 10-fold cross-validation was
used, meaning there were 10 iterations of the model for each of the 500
decision trees, each using a different group as the test set and the
remaining 9 groups as training data for the model. After all 10
iterations were complete, the resulting iterations are averaged to find
the final cross-validation model which is our random forest model.</p>
<p>It is important to test different values of k as there exists a
tradeoff between model accuracy and computational expense. Each
iteration requires the entire model to run, so this can get very
computationally expensive depending on the size of the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mtry">mtry<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mtry"></a>
</h4>
<p>The mrty parameter controls the number of variables tried at each
split. During tre decision tree construcrion process, the confirmation
that no two trees look exactly the same must be investiagted. More
specifically, this mtry parameter controls the number of input features
a decision tree is ablw to consider at any momnet during this tree
construction and controls how much randomness is added during the
process. Testing different values of mtry is crucial and can greatly
impact the model’s performance. For every new split that is added as a
node to a decision tree, mtry controls how many of the principle
component variables are allowed to be considered for each successive
split.</p>
<p>If the value of mtry is too large and each model has access to all
features as every split, there will not be as much randomness in the
model and the decision trees may look very similar to each other,
reducing the benefits of building multiple independent decision trees.
Two common heuristics for choosing an mtry value is for the value of the
parameter to either be the square root of or log base 2 of the total
number of features. For the example below, those values end up being
about 4.47 and 4.32, respectively; 4 was chosen to avoid the effect of a
large mtry that diminishes the randomness in the model.</p>
